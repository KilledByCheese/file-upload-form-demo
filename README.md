 This Project is a simple react application to show the Content of a selected JSON File.  
 Additionally it offers the functionality to download the Content of the JSON file into a new file.  

### Running
  
After pulling navigate into the folder and run ```npm install``` to install the necessary ```node_modules```.
Start the Application with ```npm start``` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  
  
The application shows a simple form with a file input. After choosing and submitting a ```*.json```-file the content of the selected file is displayed on the page.  
With the ```Save File``` Button the User can download the content of the selected JSON file into a new file.  
  
The App uses ```react-hook-form``` for handling the form input.
